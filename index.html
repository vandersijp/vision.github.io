<h2>World-class production</h2>
<h5>Vision</h5><p>Flexible production capacity, minimal material waste, high-quality products, high productivity, and adaptable operations will allow UK manufacturing to thrive</p>
<h5>Scope</h5><p>through-life and multidisciplinary design engineering with support of digital tools to de-risk and prototype new ideas</p>
<h5>UK strengths</h5><p>UK strengths in high-value design, complex systems with through-life engineering and digital technologies and information management can set us apart from global competition.</p>

<h3>Global outlook</h3>

<p>Outlook intro: In 2050, manufacturing is fully optimised to seamlessly flex capacity and meet dynamic demand. Autonomy is commonplace, and reliable self-maintaining systems support rapid adaptation. High-precision manufacturing leads to optimal use of resources and revolutionises product life. Low energy manufacturing techniques are the norm. Water use is optimally reduced across manufacturing operations and in materials production. Technology and automation are readily adopted and ensure high-value employment.</p>

<h4>Optimally distributed manufacturing</h4><p>UK manufacturing consists of many small and some very large manufacturing sites and is well placed to grow and adopt two forms of manufacturing in parallel – distributed manufacturing and large centralised factories alongside each other. There is a huge opportunity to reshore high- value design and production and to create high-value jobs in the UK.</p><div><h5>Trends and challenges</h5><p>Promissing trends are gigafactories, on-demand manufacturing.Other trends are horizontal integration, distributed manufacturing, microfactories, vertical integration, pseudo-continuous manufacturing.</p></div>
<h4>Planned & scheduled production</h4><p>UK manufacturing can design and build more production machinery and tooling and reduce its dependence on other countries. Being at the forefront of the energy transition and the hydrogen economy UK manufacturing can revive its foundation industries.</p><div><h5>Trends and challenges</h5><p></p></div>
<h4>Less waste during production</h4><p>Zero-defect and high-precision manufacturing radically improve product quality, reduce wear, and eliminate overdesign. The UK can leverage its strengths in material science and metrology to design and make, for example, mechanical microdevices for medical applications. Expertise in highly complex products and systems integration is an opportunity to further reduce waste.</p><div><h5>Trends and challenges</h5><p>Promissing trends are self-calibrating tooling, miniaturisation, nano-lithography, laser metal deposition, resource efficiency, bill of materials reduction.Other trends are portable metrology, high-integrity welding, surface metrology, net-shape manufacturing, microsystems, low-weight power electronics, compact and micro assemblies.</p></div>
<h4>Less unproductive work</h4><p>The UK is well placed to adopt a human-centred approach that will make manufacturing an appealing place to work and learn, attracting the talent to increase high-value productivity. The UK’s leading role in implementing AI responsibly will minimise unintended ethical consequences. There is an opportunity to lead design and best practice for human-robot interaction in manufacturing. The UK will leverage the Catapult network and the Innovate UK Knowledge Transfer Network to replicate good practices and boost the productivity of SMEs.</p><div><h5>Trends and challenges</h5><p>Promissing trends are remote working, virtual meetings, robotics, co-bots, exoskeletons, voice controlled operation, touchless control, no-code programming, low-code programming, technology democratisation.Other trends are bring your own environment, holoportation, no-SQL data.There are also challenges such as work patterns, work morale, workplace safety, occupational health risks, mental health, human-robot interaction, superintelligence, singularity.</p></div>
<h4>Less worry about machine failures</h4><p>UK expertise in building military equipment with cyber security and broader security approaches ensures always being one step ahead of any cyber security threat. It will make UK manufacturing more robust and can generate new security related services. More predictive maintenance and wireless sensor fusion will improve system reliability and integration. The UK’s strength in AI, metrology and photonics can play a critical role in developing self- calibrating tooling and self-maintaining equipment.</p><div><h5>Trends and challenges</h5><p>Promissing trends are predictive maintenance, self-healing software.Other trends are predictive analytics.There are also challenges such as cyber security, ransomware, unreliability of local storage, business continuity planning, digital & power continuity.</p></div>
<h4>Optimally adaptive factories</h4><p>Meeting the unpredictable demand for new products requires adaptivity. The UK has strong experience in the automotive and aerospace industries as well as the industrial internet of things, sensors and additive manufacturing. This makes UK manufacturing well placed to lead the transition towards Industry 4.0, leading to industry 5.0, building self-configurable factories that can rapidly repurpose themselves.</p><div><h5>Trends and challenges</h5><p>Promissing trends are production networks, robotic swarms, synthetic sensors, industrial internet of things (IIoT), edge computing, low-power wireless, 5G, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), additive manufacturing (AM).Other trends are process integration, interoperability, long-range WAN (LoRa), self-healing network alliances, adaptive factories, self-assembling structures, robogami.</p></div>
